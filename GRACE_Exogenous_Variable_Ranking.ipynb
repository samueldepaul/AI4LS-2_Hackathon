    "## Combined Predictive Power Metric (CPPM) - Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Let **$X$** represent the feature matrix and **$y$** the target variable (which can be multiple outputs in the case of multi-step forecasting).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each feature **$f_i$** in the feature matrix **$X$**, we compute three separate metrics that quantify its predictive power:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Importance ($S_{FI}$)**: Denoted as $S_{FI}(f_i)$, it represents the importance of feature **$f_i$** as determined by the model's internal feature importance mechanism (e.g., CatBoost's built-in feature importance method).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SHAP Values ($S_{SHAP}$)**: Denoted as $S_{SHAP}(f_i)$, these are the SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values representing the average impact of feature **$f_i$** on the model's predictions across different samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Recursive Feature Elimination ($S_{RFE}$)**: Denoted as $S_{RFE}(f_i)$, this metric is computed by performing Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), ranking features based on how much their removal affects the model's performance. To align this with other metrics (higher values = better), we take the **inverse of the ranking** and scale it by the model's performance drop when the feature is removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Normalization:\n",
    "Each score is normalized to ensure comparability across features. The normalization for each metric $S_{FI}(f_i), S_{SHAP}(f_i), S_{RFE}(f_i)$ is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{S}(f_i) = \\frac{S(f_i) - \\min(S)}{\\max(S) - \\min(S)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $\\hat{S}(f_i)$ is the normalized score for feature **$f_i$**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Combined Predictive Power Metric:\n",
    "The CPPM for feature **$f_i$** is computed as a weighted sum of the normalized scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "CPPM(f_i) = w_1 \\hat{S}_ {FI}(f_i) + w_2 \\hat{S}_ {SHAP}(f_i) + w_3 \\hat{S}_{RFE}(f_i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $w_1, w_2, w_3$ are the weights assigned to the respective metrics (e.g. $w_1 = 0.33, w_2 = 0.34, w_3 = 0.33$ by default).\n",
    "- $\\hat{S}_ {FI}(f_i)$ , $\\hat{S}_ {SHAP}(f_i)$ , $\\hat{S}_{RFE}(f_i)$ are the normalized scores for **Feature Importance**, **SHAP values**, and **RFE rankings** respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Final CPPM for Ranking:\n",
    "For multi-step forecasting, the **CPPM** for each feature is averaged across all 60 steps and across both the independent and multioutput models:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$CPPM_{\\text{final}}(f_i) = \\frac{1}{2} \\left( \\frac{1}{60} \\sum_{k=1}^{60} CPPM_k(f_i) + CPPM_{\\text{multioutput}}(f_i) \\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $CPPM_k(f_i)$ is the **CPPM** for feature **f_i** for step **k**.\n",
    "- $CPPM_{\\text{multioutput}}(f_i)$ is the **CPPM** for feature **f_i** when using the multioutput model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final score provides a comprehensive measure of each feature’s predictive power, allowing us to rank the features accordingly.\n"
